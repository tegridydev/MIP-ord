# Matrix Inscription Protocol (MIP) v0.0.2

## Overview

The Matrix Inscription Protocol (MIP) is a proof of concept designed to reduce Bitcoin Ordinal Inscription file sizes and costs. Leveraging Large Language Model Quantization and Compression Theory, MIP aims to combat Bitcoin core chain and network spam.

## Summary

By applying advanced quantization and compression techniques, MIP minimizes inscription file sizes, reducing transaction fees and optimizing network performance.

## Key Objectives

1. **File Size Reduction**: Use quantization and compression to minimize inscription data.
2. **Cost Efficiency**: Lower transaction fees by reducing data size.
3. **Network Optimization**: Mitigate network spam and improve efficiency.

## Concept

Inspired by Large Language Models (LLMs) and their quantization methods, MIP applies similar techniques to Bitcoin Ordinal Inscriptions to achieve smaller file sizes and reduced costs.

## Implementation

1. **Data Reading and Processing**: Read and prepare inscription data.
2. **Quantization**: Apply quantization techniques to reduce data precision.
3. **Compression**: Further reduce data size using advanced algorithms.
4. **Verification**: Ensure data integrity by verifying decompressed data against the original.
